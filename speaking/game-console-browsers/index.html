  <h5>Description</h5>

  <p>We're now living with a huge number of devices with browsers, from <a href="http://console.maban.co.uk/">game consoles</a> to <a href="http://maban.co.uk/94/">smart watches</a>, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/8023597/HP-announces-apps-and-printers-that-dont-need-computers.html">printers</a> to <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/117409-opera-pioneer-carbrowser-app-available">cars</a>. That range is only going to get weirder.</p>

  <p>It may be convenient to disregard the browsers in these devices as being a novelty, but people are using them. In 2011, Ofcom reported that in the UK, <a href="http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/market-data-research/market-data/communications-market-reports/cmr11/internet-web/4.16">20% of 16-24 year olds use their game console to visit websites</a>.</p>

  <p>Browsing the internet on these devices presents us with new challenges, such as building sites that could be interacted with using voice, gesture, a second-screen, using a d-pad or a stylus. Considering how your site will be used by people on these devices will not only benefit your current users, but also prepare you for people using devices that don't exist yet.</p>

  <p>Itâ€™s time to look beyond desktop, tablet and smartphone browsers.</p>
