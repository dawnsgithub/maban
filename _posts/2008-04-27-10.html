title: A 7-year-old's picture of me
---

<p>There&#8217;s a really sweet girl I babysit, and last night, she drew a picture of me.  It took her about 15 minutes, and I was so happy with the result that I thought I&#8217;d post it up here.</p>

    <img src="/image/photo-a-7-year-olds-picture.jpg" alt="A hand drawn picture of me"/>

<p>So the chin may be a bit humungus, and the hair a little crazy, but she put so much care into doing it that I was really flattered.  (I was expecting her to draw me with 2 noses, or a monobrow or something!)</p>
