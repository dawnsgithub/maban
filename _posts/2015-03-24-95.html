title: The most convenient tool for the job
---

<p>So, I recently bought a new lamp, and it had a part that needed unscrewing. Now, I've got a really fancy screwdriver. It's an ergonomic, ratcheting screwdriver and it's ace.</p>

<p>But it was my toolbox, and I just wanted to get this lamp set up so I could use it. And just across from me there just happened to be this shitty screwdriver that could have came out of a Christmas cracker. So I used that. And it did the job. It wasn't great, but it did the job.</p>

<p>And that's what the browsers on devices like phones, game consoles and smart watches are like. We'll sometimes use whatever's closest to hand. It might not be the best tool for the job, but if it can still do a good enough job, so what?</p>
