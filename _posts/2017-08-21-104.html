title: Making the switch
---

<p>I've been meaning to write this post for, well, basically since I signed my contract at <a href="https://snyk.io/">Snyk</a> over a year ago. Since then, lots of people have asked me what compelled me to switch from freelancing to working full time for a startup, so here goes…</p>

<p>Back in July 2015, I got an email from <a href="https://www.guypo.com/about/">Guy Podjarny</a> asking for feedback on his new security startup. He said he'd seen me speak at a conference I'd never actually spoken at. I didn't know Guy at the time, and I was busy on a contract so I left it unanswered in my inbox. A few days later, he nudged me, and I gave a slightly curt response back saying I was busy but wished him all the luck with his startup.</p>

<p>A couple of months later, he emailed me <em>again</em>, saying he was working with my friend Remy Sharp, and that he was looking for more people for the team. Again, I told him I was busy, hoped that would be the end of it, and he responded asking if he could bug me again in 2 months time. I said sure, and expected to not hear from him again.</p>

<p>2 months later, sure enough, Guy was in touch again, asking to meet for a chat. He mentioned that my friend Johanna Kollmann was working with him. At this point, I'd run out of excuses, and was coming up to the end of the contract I was on, so I agreed to meet him in the vague hope that he would stop emailing me. He gave me the address to the office which was upstairs through a café – you actually had to go inside the café to get into the building, and when I got there, he showed me Snyk.</p>

<p>At the time, it was pretty much entirely a CLI tool, and Guy ran me through screens of green text. I didn't really understand most of what he was telling me, but the security aspect interested me – I didn't know much about security but I wanted to know more, and what better way than to work with security experts. The website had been put together in a very short space of time and it was one of those things where making a few small changes would have a big impact on the usability. They really needed a front-ender. Guy wanted me to consider joining full time but I agreed to a short term contract (with the provision that I'd reconsider joining full time at the end). Half the team was based in Tel Aviv, which meant trips there, and I'd be working with Remy, one of the best developers I know, and Johanna, one of the best UXers I know.</p>

<p>I was planning to take a break between my previous contract finishing and a new one starting (timed with the release of Fallout 4 so I could gourge on gaming for a couple of weeks), but Guy convinced me to join sooner. It was an incredibly steep learning curve – Everything was written in Node.js, so I was using that for the first time. It felt so unfamiliar. There was so much I didn't understand and I was afraid to ask because I felt I should already <em>know</em> this stuff. I'm normally brought in on projects as an expert, and I felt far from it. I really struggled in those first few weeks. I started looking forward to the end of the contract so I could climb out of the deep end and go back to doing something more familiar.</p>

<p>Soon there were new people on the team. We had a designer, and a VP of engineering (who became my manager). But there was one more hurdle before I finished my contract – a trip was planned to the Tel Aviv office. I think it was this week that changed my mind. I got to work with the whole team in one room, and maybe it was the delicious pita bread and hummus they kept feeding us, but I suddenly felt really excited about the project.</p>

<p>When I work as a consultant, I'm there for a relatively short period of time, usually to help launch a site. It's fun, but I rarely get to stick around and see what effect my decisions have made in the long term. I don't get to form a proper bond with my teammates. I don't have a manager to report to, which is nice in a lot of ways, but I hear the people I'm working on the project with talk about a useful 1:1 session they've had and I wonder what it's like. The only real feedback I'd get on my work is whether I get asked back at the end of the contract.</p>

<p>2015 was my best year working for myself. I'd earnt more than previous years, I'd finally got the hang of doing all the different taxes and forms related to running a business, and had given lots of talks in different countries. But, I felt like I'd reached a ceiling. I knew that next year would probably be more of the same. I'd been working for myself for 8 years, and the work was not a whole lot different to when I started. I'd always been waiting for the right role to come along, but I got comfortable working for myself. Was this the right role? Possibly, possibly not, but I could help influence a product that may or may not become successful. And how awesome would it feel if it did become successful? How would I feel if I didn't join, and some other Front End dev came along and sat in <em>my</em> chair and… wow, I'm starting to feel quite attached to this thing.</p>

<p>At first, I was apprehensive about working for a startup – I've heard so many bad things – egotistical CEOs, bad pay, long hours. But that wasn't my experience at Snyk. Guy, our CEO, is calm, smart, he has 2 young kids and he understands that family overrides work. He's successfully run another startup before.</p>

<p>Plus, I feel like what I'm working on matters. I'm not helping an agency help a fashion label sell more shoes – I'm building software that helps make open source more secure.</p>

<p>So at the end of my contract, I signed to join as a full time employee at Snyk. My company still exists, ticking along in the background, just not earning anything other than book sales. I'm making a bit less than I did freelancing, but it's still good pay, and I also have options.</p>

<p>I'm still really glad I did. There has been a lot to do, a lot to learn, and I've had days when I've felt really stressed by it all… but looking back to where I was when I've started, I've learnt so much in such a short space of time. I've been able to influence so much of what goes on day to day. And I'm really excited about what's to come.</p>

<p>I could gush for hours about Snyk. We're not perfect and we're certainly not glamourous – we don't have free lunches, slides or nap pods like other tech companies (you should have seen how excited the London office was the day the water cooler arrived). But somehow we still have fun.</p>

<p>So now you know.</p>
