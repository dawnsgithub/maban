title: Chessbrook Education Centre
---

<p>Chessbrook is the second school I have worked with.  It was a really great project to work on because it was quite challenging.  The school is an education centre for students who have not been able to cope in mainstream education.</p>

<p>I really like what Chessbrook are doing, and they were perfect clients to work with.  At the end of the project, I did usability testing with the students to get their feedback on the website.</p>
