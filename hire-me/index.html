<blockquote>
  <p>Anna has everything you could ask for in a front-end developer: an excellent skillset of markup and CSS, augmented by a keen and inquiring mind.</p>
  <p>Jeremy Keith, Director, Clearleft</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Anna worked at Clearleft as an Intern for 3 months, but we liked her so much we asked her to stay on for a further 2.</p>
  <p>Anna is sharp, enthusiastic and willing to get stuck-in. She's incredibly conscientious and will always go the extra mile to make sure the work get's done on time and to a high standard.</p>
  <p>Andy Budd, Director, Clearleft</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not only is Anna an excellent front-end developer but she also has a strong grasp of visual design, meaning her implementations pay attention to the important little details that can often be missed by others. Futhermore, her work to improve web design education in schools and for young people shows a true commitment to the profession and a desire to be the best in the business.</p>

<blockquote>
