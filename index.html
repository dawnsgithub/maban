  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div class="lede">

    <p>Hi! I'm Anna, a Front-end Developer at <a href="http://snyk.io">Snyk</a> in London in the UK. In 2013, I was awarded <a href="https://thenetawards.com/previous-winners/">Netmag's Young Developer of the Year</a>.</p>

    <p>In 2015, I co-hosted a small-batch podcast with Brad Frost on Front-end Style Guides, and <a href="/projects/front-end-style-guides/">I've written a book on the topic</a>. I'm also interested in the browsers on various game consoles, and <a href="http://console.maban.co.uk/">I've made a site documenting these</a>.</p>

    <p>As well as developing websites, I'm also a Technical Editor for <a href="http://alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a>, and I was the Technical Editor of <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">the second edition of Ethan Marcotte's <cite>Responsive Web Design</cite></a>.</p>

    <p>Every December, I co-produce <a href="http://24ways.org/">24 Ways</a>.</p>
